# Query-decision Regression with Task Shift

**Query-decision Regression between Shortest Path and Minimum Steiner Tree, PAKDD 2024**

Considering a graph with unknown weights, can we find the shortest path for a pair of nodes (a-d) if we know the minimal Steiner trees
associated with some subset of nodes (e-h)?

Paper: arxiv

SP.py and Steiner.py contain classes related to tasks of shortest path and minimum Steiner tree.

StoGraph.py and USCO.py contain classes of abstract query-decision regression problems


QRTS_Solver.py contains the implementation of QRTS-P and QRTS-PD.


"data" contains graphs and samples.

Thank you.
